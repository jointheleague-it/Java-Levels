  # Houses
  1. Have a robot start on the left side of the window near the bottom.


    2. Draw a flat-topped house of height 100 with grass after it (see picture).


    3. Extract the piece of code that draws the house into a method. Draw 10 houses. 


    4. Change the method to take (int height) as a parameter. Draw 9 houses of different heights 


    5. Make the method take a String instead of an int. 


            “small”                 60


            “medium”
                120

        “large”
                    250 


    6. Make the method take a color as well as a height. The houses are drawn in that color.

[optional] Set the scene to night by setting the background to black


    7. Give the houses peaked roofs 


    8. Extract that roof code into a method “drawPointyRoof” and create a new method: “drawFlatRoof”.


    9. Make large houses have flat roofs
