  # Pig Latin Translator
  We are going to make a translator (similar to Google translate) that converts English to Pig Latin.
  1. Make a UI that looks something like this:



2. Using the PigLatinTranslator class in the package, create a program that:
  <ul style="margin-left:40px;">
   <li>
    Translates a word in English to Pig Latin when a button is pressed.
   </li>
   <li>
    Translates a word in Pig Latin to English when a button is pressed.
   </li>
   <li>
    Make the computer speak the Pig Latin phrase (using
    <b>
     Sound.speak(words)
    </b>
    ) when a button is pressed.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </div>
